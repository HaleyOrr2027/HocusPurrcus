⚠️This project is very much still a work in progress. Things change a lot as I experiment, break stuff, and rebuild it⚠️

Hocus Purrcus is an experimental game where you play as a wizard battling spell-casting opponents on screen using a physical wand controller instead of a keyboard or mouse. 
The game has a playful, doodle-style aesthetic inspired by wizard cats and sketchbook art! Players battle wizards on screen using a physical wand instead of a keyboard or mouse. 
You’ll have to learn spell movements to block, dodge, and attack - sometimes even moving your body left or right to stop incoming spells. Aiming matters too, as enemies move around
the screen and you’ll need to track them while staying on the move yourself.

The project is experimenting with an IR camera system inspired by how the Nintendo Wii remote. The wand will track IR points and estimate where it’s aimed, so spells can be
targeted by physically pointing instead of relying only on keyboard buttons.
